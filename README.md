# Portfolio

#### My personal website - Built with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) 
 [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c0f9e111-12d6-426d-87fa-3450d7052da6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/madhavi-jaival-portfolio/deploys)

This is the first iteration of my personal website. The project is under ongoing development. However, feel free to use it as a basis for your own portfolio - please just read the note below first. And if you find any bugs or improvements, let me know!



## Note
I've made my portfolio open source for your inspiration. I think, especially for beginners, it can be hard to get a first starting point. So feel free to build your portfolio up on mine. However, if you do so, please leave a tiny hint on your site that links to my site [madhavi-portfolio](https://madhavi-jaival-portfolio.netlify.app/). Thanks and happy coding!
