Hello! I'm Madhavi Jaival.

I taught myself programming from scratch. I don’t just wait for things to happen at work— I proactively and eagerly pursue them.

I am pursuing my Masters from [Califonria State University, Northridge](https://w2.csun.edu/) in Computer Science my current GPA is [3.6]() out of 4.

Currently, I am a Software Developer Intern at [SubmitIt](https://submitit.io/)

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
