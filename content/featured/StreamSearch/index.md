This project was developed using the Scrum framework. It simplifies the process of selecting
content to watch from multiple streaming services such as Netflix, and Amazon Prime.

We employed the Streaming Availability API for this project, and the frontend code was
written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. We used AWS's DynamoDB and Lambda services in
the backend.
